    <string name="light">
        Applying the light in a right way will make good impression by any photo you take – that is why it is an essential thing to keep in mind. You can get the best shot when the subject is lit from the side or from the front.
    </string>

    <string name="zoom">
        If you want to take a good picture, forget about zooming using your phone! A better solution for zooming is to move yourself or change an angle you want to take picture from. If moving is not possible, you can crop the picture later to get the desired shot.
    </string>

    <string name="backgroundtips">
        I can\'t even describe how often I\'ve taken a great shot, only to be unable to enter it into a contest because something in the background doesn\'t look right. So before you click that button, make sure that everything looks right. Learning how to see the world like your camera does can help with this.
    </string>
    <string name="frame">
        Try to place the objects in the foreground to frame the main subjects in your picture. Windows, arches, doorways etc. can form natural frames. 
    </string>
    
    <string name="perspective">
        Pictures taken from different angles are more buzzworthy. Change your place and take some original shots! Try to use apps as well to add some special effects. 
    </string>
    
    <string name="crop">
        Nowadays we all have hectic lifestyles so very often we don’t have much time to think carefully about the composition when taking a picture, so the advice is to take a wider picture. You can modify it latter by cropping unnecessary parts if needed.  </string>
    <string name="apps">
        There are a lot of apps on the market that can add significant value to the picture and allow to use DLSR camera functions and special effects while shooting. Don’t be afraid to get the best shot possible. </string>
    <string name="phnfeatures">
        Don’t forget that your phone camera has a set of features itself without using extra apps. For example, you can use HDR or turn on the grid which will help you to shoot according to the rule of thirds. As well, you can set the exposure and choose the amount of light in the picture.
